Sydent 2.4.7
============

While drafting the release of v2.4.7, we decided it would be more appropriate to release a v2.5. Two reasons for a minor version bump:

- the new room_type feature for MSC 3288
- a large number of internal refactors for type checking means that this is higher risk than a bugfix-only release.
